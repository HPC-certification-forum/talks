\begin{frame}{Challenges for HPC Training}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Not all users possess the right level of training
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Inefficient usage of systems, frustration, lost potential
				\item Good training saves compute time and costs!
				\end{itemize}
      \item Diverse user background and goals
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Science is the goal, HPC is the vehicle
          \item Need to run an application to complete the PhD
        \end{itemize}
      \item Learning is not easy
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Users need to understand beneficial knowledge for tasks
				\item There exist various different training material
				\item Teaching of different data centers is hard to compare
			\end{itemize}
			\item Data center have difficulties to verify the skills of users
		\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{hpccf-full}}
		\begin{block}{Goals}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Fine-grained standardizing HPC knowledge representation
          \begin{itemize}
            \item What competences exist, how are they defined?
            \item Puzzle of competences for everyone (practitioners, students)
            \item Supporting navigation and role-specific knowledge maps
          \end{itemize}
				\item Establishing international certificates attesting knowledge
        \item Supporting an ecosystem around the HPC competences
			\end{itemize}
		\end{block}

    \begin{block}{Scope of the forum}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Central authority for competence representation, certification, and support
      \item Purposeful limitations of the forum:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item We do not compete with content providers
				\item We do not create a curriculum (university/centers responsibility)
			\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
		\end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Skills}
\sectionIntroHidden

\begin{frame}{Classification of Competences == Skills}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A \textbf{skill} defines background, objectives, learning outcomes
		\item The \textbf{skill tree} organizes the competences as hierarchical skills
		\item Certificates bundle several skills into attestable unit
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{skill-tree}
		\vspace*{-2em}
		\caption{Top-levels of the skill tree (Initial ADM and BDA branches)}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example High-Level Skill (Shortened)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Name: SLURM Workload manager
\item Id: USE4.2.2-B
\item Background: {\small SLURM is a widely used open-source workload
manager providing various advanced features.}
\item Aim:
\begin{itemize}
\item comprehend and describe the basic architecture of SLURM and its tools
\item use relevant tools to run and monitor (parallel) applications
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Learning outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
\item run interactive jobs with salloc, a batch job with sbatch
\item explain the architecture of SLURM, i.e., the role of slurmd, srun
\item explain the function of the tools: sacct, sbatch, salloc, ...
\item explain time limits and the benefit of a backfill scheduler
\item \textit{see \url{https://www.hpc-certification.org/wiki/}}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Classification of HPC Competences}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Granularity of skill descriptions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Too fine $\Rightarrow$ content of a skill is predefined at leaf level
			\item Too coarse $\Rightarrow$ no help for structuring the material
			\item Guiding principle: leaf node should be coverable in 1-4 hour lecture/workshop
		\end{itemize}


    \item Organization of HPC skills
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Skills are typically depending on sub-skills $\Rightarrow$ tree structure
      \item References to skills are possible; still skills are building blocks for various tasks
      \item One skill can have multiple instances for different skill levels
    \end{itemize}


    \item Verification of skill tree and certification approach
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Feedback by the HPC community/practitioners justify the approaches
      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Further Considerations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Certificate definition
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bundles a set of useful skills together %(e.g. "Getting startet with HPC Clusters")
			\item A users' HPC qualification is certified by successful exams
		\end{itemize}
		\item Separation of skill, certificates and content provider
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Similar to the concept of a high school graduation exam %("Zentralabitur")
			\item Learning material can be provided by different institutions
			\item Teachers can put badges on material: this "trains XYZ"
		\end{itemize}
  	\item External information can be linked to the skills providing different \textbf{views}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Suitability for a user role (Tester, Builder, Developer)
			\item Suitability for a scientific domain (Chemistry, Physics, ...)
			\item View: purpose-specific representation / coloring / content
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Groups/institutions can derive a new skill tree with their own emphasis
				\item  What should people know to effectively work in your environment?
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
