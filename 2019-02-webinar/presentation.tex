% Title: Introducing the HPC Certification Program
% Abstract: This talk introduces the HPC Certification Forum and its
% activities to work towards an HPC certification program that will
% clearly categorize, define, and examine competencies for HPC
% practitioners.
% We will present the forum, concepts behind the program, the current
% status, and ongoing activities.
% Bio: Julian Kunkel is Lecturer in Computer Science at the University
% of Reading and managing the Performance Conscious HPC project which
% contributes to the HPC Certification Forum.
% He strongly believes that international recognition of skills will
% help the HPC ecosystem.




\section{The Program}
\sectionIntroHidden

\subsection{}

\begin{frame}{HPC Certification Program}
	\begin{block}{Motivation}
		\begin{itemize}

			\item Not all users possess the right level of training
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Inefficient usage of systems, frustration, lost potential
				\item Good training saves compute time and costs!
				\end{itemize}
			\item Learning is not easy
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Users need to understand beneficial knowledge for tasks
				\item There exist various different training material
				\item Teaching of different data centers is hard to compare
			\end{itemize}
			\item Data center have difficulties to verify the skills of users
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{The HPC Certification Program}
		\begin{block}{Goals}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Standardizing HPC knowledge representation
          \begin{itemize}
						\item What competences exist, how are they defined?
            \item Supporting navigation and role-specific knowledge maps
          \end{itemize}
				\item Establishing international certificates attesting knowledge
			\end{itemize}
		\end{block}

		\textit{The work was bootstraped and is supported by the PeCoH project}
		\begin{block}{Important!}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item We do not compete with content providers
				\item We do not intent to create a curriculum
			\end{itemize}
		\end{block}



\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Contributions by the PeCoH Project\footnote[frame]{PeCoH was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grants LU 1353/12-1, OL 241/2-1, and RI 1068/7-1.}}
	\begin{block}{Past contributions}
		\vspace*{-2mm}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Initial classification of competences
			\item Initial development of a certification program
			\item Prototype for the online examination
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{block}

  The program will be curated by the \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{hpccf-full}

  \begin{block}{Pending independent contributions}
    \begin{itemize}
			\item Creation of workshop material for (a) basic certificate(s)
			\item Providing an online tutorial for (a) basic certificate(s)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Content of the Certification Program}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Skill is characterized by ID, background, objectives, outcomes
		\item Skill tree defining the organization of the competences
		\item Certificates bundle several skills into attestable unit
	\end{itemize}

		\begin{figure}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{skill-tree}
			\caption{Top-levels of the skill tree (We are working on ADM and BDA)}
		\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example High-Level Skill}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Name: SLURM Workload manager
		\item Id: USE4.2.2-B
		\item Background: {\small SLURM is a widely used open-source workload manager providing various advanced features.}
		\item Objectives:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item comprehend and describe the basic architecture of SLURM and its tools
			\item use relevant tools to run and monitor (parallel) applications
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{block}{Outcomes}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item run interactive jobs with salloc, a batch job with sbatch
			\item explain the architecture of SLURM, i.e., the role of slurmd, srun
			\item explain the function of the tools: sacct, sbatch, salloc, ...
			\item explain time limits and the benefit of a backfill scheduler
			\item (see \url{https://www.hpc-certification.org/wiki/})
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Classification of HPC Competences}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item HPC skills are generally built upon one another
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Skills are typically depending on sub-skills $\Rightarrow$ tree structure
			\item References to skills are possible; still skills are building blocks for various tasks
		\end{itemize}

		\item Additional attributes are currently used to describe:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Level of a skill (Basic, Intermediate, Expert)
			\item Suitability for a user role (Tester, Builder, Developer)
			\item Suitability for a scientific domain (Chemistry, Physics, ...)
		\end{itemize}
		\item We will extract these attributes to generate "views" on the content
			\begin{itemize}
				\item View: purpose-specific representation / coloring / content
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Considerations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Granularity of skill descriptions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Too fine $\Rightarrow$ content of a skill is predefined at leaf level
			\item Too coarse $\Rightarrow$ no help for structuring the material
			\item Guiding principle: leaf node should be coverable in 2-4 hour lecture/workshop
		\end{itemize}

		\item Certificate definition
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bundles a set of useful skills together %(e.g. "Getting startet with HPC Clusters")
			\item A users' HPC qualification is certified by successful exams
		\end{itemize}
		\item Separation of skill, certificates and content provider
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Similar to the concept of a high school graduation exam %("Zentralabitur")
			\item Learning material can be provided by different institutions
			\item Teachers can put badges on material: this "trains XYZ"
		\end{itemize}
		\item Support flexible usage (views on skill tree) and skills is key
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Institutions can derive new skill tree with own groups \\
			e.g. users in weather/climate, single program, testers
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Status}
		\begin{block}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A structure of the skill tree is released (35 basic skills)
				\item We are working on descriptions for (learning) objectives and outcomes
				\item Idea been discussed to DKRZ user group; they want it yesterday
				\item Technical representation of the HPC skills
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Database for the HPC certification program
					\item Implementation is based on XML with Schema
				  \item A markdown version and editable wiki exists but is yet not synchronized
				\end{itemize}
				\item JavaScript for visualization of skill tree \hrefb{https://www.hpc-certification.org/skills/}{(Live Demo)}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Can be embedded in your webpage and adapted
							\begin{itemize}
								\item Role/software-specific knowledge
								\item What should people know to effectively work in your environment?
							\end{itemize}
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Certification}
	\begin{block}{Approach}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item User takes online multiple-choice test
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A combination of JavaScript and a web service
				\item System selects number of questions randomly from a pool
				\item System draws 4-5 responses from 10 possible responses
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Some responses may be parameterized (random)
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			\item Choices are submitted to the web server
			\item Manual approval of the result
			\item Automatic creation of certificate and return by email
			\item Permanent computer-verifiable proof that skill was obtained
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Return a text version with GPG signature
				\item Return a link that can be verified on hpc-certification.org
			\end{itemize}
			\item Includes some measure to prevent cheating and brute forcing (e.g., delay)
		\end{itemize}
