% Title: Introducing the HPC Certification Program
% Abstract: This talk introduces the HPC Certification Forum and its
% activities to work towards an HPC certification program that will
% clearly categorize, define, and examine competencies for HPC
% practitioners.
% We will present the forum, concepts behind the program, the current
% status, and ongoing activities.
% Bio: Julian Kunkel is Lecturer in Computer Science at the University
% of Reading and managing the Performance Conscious HPC project which
% contributes to the HPC Certification Forum.
% He strongly believes that international recognition of skills will
% help the HPC ecosystem.




\section{The Program}
\sectionIntroHidden

\subsection{}

\begin{frame}{HPC Certification Program}
	\begin{block}{Motivation}
		\begin{itemize}

			\item Not all users possess the right level of training
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Inefficient usage of systems, frustration, lost potential
				\item Good training saves compute time and costs!
				\end{itemize}
			\item Learning is not easy
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Users need to understand beneficial knowledge for tasks
				\item There exist various different training material
				\item Teaching of different data centers is hard to compare
			\end{itemize}
			\item Data center have difficulties to verify the skills of users
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{The HPC Certification Program}
		\begin{block}{Goals}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Standardizing HPC knowledge representation
          \begin{itemize}
						\item What competences exist, how are they defined?
            \item Supporting navigation and role-specific knowledge maps
          \end{itemize}
				\item Establishing international certificates attesting knowledge
			\end{itemize}
		\end{block}

		\textit{The work was bootstraped and is supported by the PeCoH project}
		\begin{block}{Important!}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item We do not compete with content providers
				\item We do not intent to create a curriculum
			\end{itemize}
		\end{block}



\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Contributions by the PeCoH Project\footnote[frame]{PeCoH was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grants LU 1353/12-1, OL 241/2-1, and RI 1068/7-1.}}
	\begin{block}{Past contributions}
		\vspace*{-2mm}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Initial classification of competences
			\item Initial development of a certification program
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{block}

  The program will be curated by the \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{hpccf-full}

  \begin{block}{Pending contributions}
    \begin{itemize}
			\item Creation of workshop material for basic certificates
			\item Providing an online tutorial  for basic certificates
			\item Enabling an online examination
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Content of the Certification Program}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Skill is characterized by unique key, background, knowledge covered
		\item Skill tree defining the organization of the competences
		\item Certificates bundle several skills into attestable unit
	\end{itemize}

		\begin{figure}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{skill-tree_top_levels}
			\caption{Top-levels of the skill tree}
		\end{figure}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Content is \textbf{NOT} covered and subject to content providers
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We may link good content on our page
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example High-Level Skill (Version 0.5)}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Name: Hardware Architectures
		\item Id: K1.2-B
		\item Level: Basic
		\item Category: HPC Knowledge
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{block}{Description of knowledge, i.e., what will the user learn}
		The skill delivers a high-level overview of:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Elementary processing elements like CPUs, GPUs, many core architectures
			\item Vector systems, and FPGAs
			\item The NUMA architecture used for symmetric multiprocessing
			\item Network demands for HPC systems (e.g. high bandwidth and low latency)
			\item Typical network architectures like fast Ethernet (1 or 10 Gbit) or InfiniBand
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classification of HPC Competences}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item HPC skills are generally built upon one another
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Skills are typically depending on sub-skills $\Rightarrow$ tree structure
			\item References to skills are possible; still skills are building blocks for various tasks
		\end{itemize}

		\item Additional attributes are used to describe:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Level of a skill (Basic, Intermediate, Expert)
			\item Suitability for a user role (Tester, Builder, Developer)
			\item Suitability for a scientific domain (Chemistry, Physics, ...)
		\end{itemize}
		\item Skill tree supports different "views" on the content
			\begin{itemize}
				\item View: purpose-specific representation / coloring / content
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Considerations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Granularity of skill descriptions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Too fine $\Rightarrow$ content of a skill is predefined at leaf level
			\item Too coarse $\Rightarrow$ no help for structuring the material
			\item Actual skill tree contains 76 skills
		\end{itemize}

		\item Certificate definition
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bundles a set of skills %(e.g. "Getting startet with HPC Clusters")
			\item A users' HPC qualification is certified by successful exams
		\end{itemize}
		\item Separation of skill, certificates and content provider
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Similar to the concept of a high school graduation exam %("Zentralabitur")
			\item Learning material can be provided by different institutions
			\item Teachers can put badges on material: this "trains XYZ"
		\end{itemize}
		\item Support flexible usage (views on skill tree) and skills is key
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Institutions can derive new skill tree with own groups \\
			e.g. users in weather/climate, single program, testers
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Status}
		\begin{block}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A first version of the skill tree is released (35 basic skills)
				\item Idea been discussed to DKRZ user group; they want it yesterday
				\item Technical representation of the HPC skills
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Database for the HPC certification program
					\item Implementation is based on XML
					\item Corresponding XML Schema (XSD) assures consistency
					\item Contribution is available on GitHub \\
					\url{https://github.com/HPC-certification-forum/curriculum}
				\end{itemize}
				\item JavaScript for visualization of skill tree
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Can be embedded in your webpage and adapted
							\begin{itemize}
								\item Role/software-specific knowledge
								\item What should people know to effectively work in your environment?
							\end{itemize}
					\end{itemize}
					\item \hrefb{https://www.hpc-certification.org/skills/}{Live Demo}

\begin{frame}{Certification}
	\begin{block}{Approach}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item User takes online multiple-choice test
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Likely to use a combination of JavaScript and a web service
				\item System selects number of questions randomly from a pool
				\item System draws 4-5 responses from 10 possible responses
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Some responses may be parameterized (random)
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			\item Choices are submitted to the web server
			\item Manual approval of scores
			\item Automatic creation of certificate + permanent record
			\item Permanent record proofs that a certain user has a skill
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Open Questions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Affiliation program for companies?
		\item Examination
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Cheating has been a discussion, but we won't focus on this right now
				\item How to ensure that a person does not brute force the exam?
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Delay between retry?
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\item Determine legal constraints for exams (help welcome)
		\item Create a unique proof that a user has a skill
		 	\begin{itemize}
		 		\item Hash instead of person name?
		 	\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
