     Assigning HPCCF skill labels to courses is no of cost, yet they are an asset for participating sites:
     \begin{itemize}
      \item enhanced transparency of own course portfolio
      \item own portfolio can be complemented by linking to courses nearby $\curvearrowright$ (for smaller sites) not so thin anymore
      \item with transparency a plus for users
      \item with HPCCF certificates new users may have some HPC experience other than ``submitted a job'' once

      Most users
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item \ldots use $3^{rd}$ party applications \ldots

        \item \ldots perhaps a scripting course \ldots
        \item \ldots only \emph{really} interested in workflows taylored for their need.

      \item ``Hm, perhaps more knowledge in this field will be an asset when applying?''

      \item There is a time-limit per question.
      \item A registration prior to a test session is required.
     \end{enumerate}
    No online system without ID checks and other measures is safe against cheating! Yet, our measures will raise awareness.
